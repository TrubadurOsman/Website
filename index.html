                    <p>One of the most famous Soviet film-maker  Andrei Tarkovsky (the son of  a famous  poet Arseniy Tarkovsky) studied music and Arabic in Moscow before started to study in the Soviet film school.. He attracted attention with his first film, IIvanovo detstvo (1962), which won the highest prize at the Venice Film Festival.Because of this ,expectations were too high for his second film Andrei Rublyov (1969) , which was banned by the Soviet regime  . It was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival in the morning on the last day, in order to keep it from winning a prize . Solaris (1971), had an easy going topic , being accepted by many in Europe and North America as the Soviet answer to Kubrick's '2001' ( though tarkovsky did not like it), but he got into official trouble again with Mirror (1975). Stalker (1979) had to be completely reshot because Tarkovsky realized that during the shots wrong films has been used, and after Nostalghia (1983), shot in Italy (with official approval), Tarkovsky got into Europe. His last film, Offret (1986) was shot in Sweden , and won  four prizes at the Cannes Film Festival.He died because of lung cancer in 1986 which is related to shotings of Stalker.He is considered as one the best representative of poet films and many critics say that he inherit his skills of poems from his father.
